description: How users access Open Mercato, reset credentials, and switch organizations.

Logging in is the first touchpoint for every operator. The authentication flow respects the tenant and organization model, ensuring users only see what they are allowed to manage.

## Sign-in experience

- **Email & password** – standard credentials validated against the tenant's directory. Password policies can be enforced per organization via configuration.
- **Organization context** – after signing in, users see the organizations they are allowed to operate. Selecting one sets both organization and tenant scopes for the session.
- **Remember me** – sessions persist according to the environment configuration (JWT expiration + refresh tokens).

## Landing on the dashboard

![Dashboard widgets overview](/screenshots/open-mercato-dashboard.png)

- **Modular widgets** – the dashboard tiles surface health checks, user onboarding status, recent activity, and any module-provided cards that were enabled for the tenant.
- **Role defaults** – default widget visibility is set from the Roles management screens (`packages/core/src/modules/auth/backend/roles`) so each role lands on the right data immediately.
- **Per-user overrides** – individual preferences live in the Users management screens (`packages/core/src/modules/auth/backend/users`), letting you fine-tune the widget set for specific team members.

## Resetting access

- Administrators can trigger password resets via the Users module.
- Users can request a reset link if you enable the optional password recovery module (see `packages/core/src/modules/auth`).
