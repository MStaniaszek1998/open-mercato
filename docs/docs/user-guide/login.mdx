Logging in is the first touchpoint for every operator. The authentication flow respects the tenant and organization model, ensuring users only see what they are allowed to manage.

## Sign-in experience

- **Email & password** – standard credentials validated against the tenant's directory. Password policies can be enforced per organization via configuration.
- **Organization context** – after signing in, users see the organizations they are allowed to operate. Selecting one sets both organization and tenant scopes for the session.
- **Remember me** – sessions persist according to the environment configuration (JWT expiration + refresh tokens).

## Landing on the dashboard

![Dashboard widgets overview](/screenshots/open-mercato-dashboard.png)

- **Modular widgets** – the dashboard tiles surface health checks, user onboarding status, recent activity, and any module-provided cards that were enabled for the tenant.
- **Role defaults** – configure which system health widgets appear after login from the [Users & roles management pages](./users-and-roles); each role can opt into the tiles that matter most.
- **Per-user overrides** – individual preferences live in the same management screens, letting you fine-tune the widget set for specific team members when roles are not enough.

## Resetting access

- Administrators can trigger password resets via the Users module.
- Users can request a reset link if you enable the optional password recovery module (see `packages/core/src/modules/auth`).
