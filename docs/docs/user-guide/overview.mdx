Welcome to the Open Mercato admin experience. This user guide introduces the primary screens your teams interact with day to day. Start here, then continue to specific topics like authentication, organizations, roles, and entities.

## What you see on the home page

- **Dashboard widgets** – surfaced by every enabled module. They provide real-time KPIs, shortcuts, and quick actions.
- **Navigation sidebar** – auto-generated from module metadata and filtered by the features assigned to the current user.
- **Global search** – jump to entities, admin pages, or docs without leaving the keyboard.

## Next steps

Continue to the [Login & authentication guide](./login) to understand how operators sign in, reset passwords, and switch organizations. From there you can deep dive into user management, custom entities, and role-based access control.
