description: Define custom data tables with dynamic fields, validations, and generated admin experiences.

User entities let you model line-of-business data structures without touching the codebase. Define the fields, validation rules, and presentation once, then expose the entity across the admin experience—lists, forms, navigation, and dashboards stay in sync automatically.

## Create a new entity

- **Open** **Entities → User entities** in the backend sidebar. You need the `entities.user-entities.manage` feature to add or edit definitions.
- **Click** **Create entity** and supply a name, optional description, and a slug. The slug is used to generate API routes, table identifiers, and navigation links.
- **Choose ownership** settings (tenant or organization scoped) so the runtime enforces the right filters when querying records.
- **Save** the base definition—this unlocks field and layout configuration for the new entity.

## Define fields and validation

- **Add fields** using the designer. Each field captures its label, type, optional default value, and whether it is required.
- **Apply validation** with built-in rules (`minLength`, `maxLength`, `regex`, numeric ranges, etc.). The runtime shares the same zod schema across APIs, forms, and imports, so invalid data never slips through.
- **Group fields** into sections to guide operators through complex forms. Section titles appear as collapsible groups in the generated UI.
- **Preview the schema** in the JSON viewer to double-check the resulting structure before you publish.

## Publish to the admin UI

![Custom entity list](/screenshots/open-mercato-custom-entity-records.png)

- **Toggle availability** to publish the entity. Published entities generate a records list, detail view, and CRUD form instantly.
- **Pin to navigation** by selecting a sidebar location. The item inherits feature checks, so only authorized roles see the new menu entry.
- **Customize table columns** by picking which fields surface in the list view. Columns can be reordered and marked sortable to match operator workflows.
- **Leverage generated forms**—every field renders with the correct widget, validation, and helper text. Files, select inputs, and relation-style dropdowns use shared UI components for consistency.

## Manage records with confidence

- **Create and edit data** from the generated CRUD screens. The submitted payload is validated against the entity schema, including tenant and organization scope.
- **Filter and search** using the fields you marked as filterable. The query engine automatically adds the correct `organization_id` and soft-delete filters.
- **Integrate with workflows** by consuming the generated APIs (`/api/entities/<slug>`) in automations or external systems. Tokens and RBAC features still apply.
- **Iterate safely**—updates to fields keep historical records intact. New fields default to `null` and are rolled out in a single migration when you publish changes.

- Extend authentication flows with custom screens in the [Login guide](./login).
- Explore the [custom fields overview tutorial](../customization/custom-fields-overview) to script entity creation and migrations.
