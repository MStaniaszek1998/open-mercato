The **Security → Audit Logs** page surfaces every command executed through the new undo-aware pipeline.

- **Action Log** lists create, update, and delete events with the actor, scoped tenant/organization, and when the change happened. If the last action is undoable the banner exposes an **Undo last action** button that replays the command’s `undo` handler.
- **Access Log** records read events (for example when a user opens a detail view) so administrators can inspect who looked at sensitive resources.
- Use the toggle to filter for undoable entries and the refresh button to pull the latest records without leaving the page.
- The Access Log is paginated (50 records per page by default) so you can page through longer histories without exporting data.

Undo support is currently available for directory tenants/organizations, auth users/roles, and example todos. Additional modules can opt-in by implementing command handlers with `undo` snapshots.

## Retention

Access log retention is automatic and environment-configurable:

- **Core resources** (`auth.user`, `auth.role`) are retained for **7 days** by default. Override with `AUDIT_LOGS_CORE_RETENTION_DAYS`.
- **All other resources** rotate after **8 hours** by default. Override with `AUDIT_LOGS_NON_CORE_RETENTION_HOURS`.

Configure these in your `.env` file to keep the volume of access logs under control while preserving critical trails for longer investigations.
