The **Security → Audit Logs** page surfaces every command executed through the new undo-aware pipeline.

- **Action Log** lists create, update, and delete events with the actor, scoped tenant/organization, and when the change happened. If the last action is undoable the banner exposes an **Undo last action** button that replays the command’s `undo` handler.
- **Access Log** records read events (for example when a user opens a detail view) so administrators can inspect who looked at sensitive resources.
- Use the toggle to filter for undoable entries and the refresh button to pull the latest records without leaving the page.

Undo support is currently available for directory tenants/organizations, auth users/roles, and example todos. Additional modules can opt-in by implementing command handlers with `undo` snapshots.
