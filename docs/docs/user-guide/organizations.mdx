description: Set up the organization hierarchy, understand tenant filtering, and navigate with the organization selector.

Managing organizations keeps every module tenant-safe and scoped to the right hierarchy. Use the directory tools to model subsidiaries, business units, or brand overlays without leaking data across tenants.

## Build the organization tree

- **Navigate** to **Directory → Organizations** from the admin sidebar. The list is already filtered to the organizations you can manage, based on `directory.organizations.view`.
- **Add a new organization** with the **Create organization** action. Supply a name, optional external code, and assign the tenant scope. Use the parent selector to nest entities and mirror your hierarchy.
- **Edit existing nodes** to move them inside a branch or update metadata. All changes require the `directory.organizations.manage` feature.
- **Keep context** by watching the breadcrumb above the list—the active tenant and organization path carry over to other modules automatically.
- **Built-in access** – freshly installed environments ship with `admin` and `superadmin` roles that already include `directory.organizations.view` and `directory.organizations.manage`, so they can manage the tree immediately.

## Tenant and organization filtering

- Directory-backed pages, APIs, and lists always enforce `tenantId` and `organizationId` from the authenticated session. That includes CRUD queries, dashboard widgets, and custom modules built on top of the query engine.
- When operators select a different organization, every module receives the new scope. Data reloads use the updated organization filter, so records from other branches never appear.
- Soft-deleted rows remain hidden unless the page explicitly opts into `withDeleted`, still honoring the current organization filters.

## Switch organizations from anywhere

- Use the global organization selector in the backend shell to jump between branches you are allowed to access.
- Selecting an organization raises the `organizationScopeChanged` event so client components can refetch with the correct `organizationId`.
- The selector also shows the tenant name, making it clear when you are crossing tenant boundaries before any data loads.

## Next steps

- Align role visibility with the updated hierarchy in the [Users & roles management guide](./users-and-roles).
- Revisit the [Login & authentication guide](./login) to see how organization scope flows into the dashboard experience.
