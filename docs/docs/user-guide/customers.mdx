The **Customers** module bundles company and people management, timeline tracking, and reusable lookup dictionaries. Pages auto-discover from the module metadata, so once features are assigned (`customers.*`), the navigation renders under the _Customers_ section of the admin sidebar.

## Companies workspace

- **Navigate** to **Customers → Companies** to review every organization-scoped account. Columns surface email, lifecycle stage, status, and next interaction hints. Use filters or the search box to narrow the grid without leaving the view.
- **Create or edit** companies with the action buttons in the top-right corner. Forms honour custom fields, dictionaries, and undo metadata just like people records.
- **Export** the visible slice via the kebab menu, or trigger the command bus for automations—companies share the same CRUD APIs available at `/api/customers/companies`.

## People workspace

- **List view** lives under **Customers → People** and mirrors the company tooling: scoped filters, instant search, and feature-gated actions (`customers.people.view` and `customers.people.manage`).
- **Quick create** opens a full-screen form with name, contact, company assignment, status, lifecycle stage, and dictionary-backed fields. Currency, job title, and lifecycle options are all dictionary driven.
- **Bulk context** — the header shows organization scope, undo toast, and links back to the dashboard so operators always know where they are acting.

## Person record details

Person pages keep relationship data in tabs so operators can stay in context while updating contact records.

- **Summary panel** exposes the primary company link, contact channels, status, and next interaction block. Use the inline editor to set `nextInteractionAt`, surface a label + color, or clear the reminder.
- **Notes tab** supports quick shout-outs or call summaries. `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` saves the message, and undo hooks roll back mistakes instantly.
- **Activities tab** tracks logged calls, emails, or meetings. Every activity entry shows subject, timestamp, icon, highlight colour, and author.
- **Deals tab** lists opportunities linked to the person. Pair it with the companies view to understand account coverage.
- **Addresses tab** keeps multiple labeled addresses. Mark primaries, edit inline, or add another location.
- **Tasks tab** displays todos linked via the task widget so customer-related follow-ups are one click away.

### Manage the interaction timeline

- **Next interaction** widgets let operators set scheduled follow-ups with labels, optional icon, and highlight colour. The block surfaces on the list view to help prioritise outreach.
- **Log activities** with the dialog below.

- **Timeline view** renders the structured activities back inline so the team can read the call log without switching tabs.

### Maintain addresses

- The address tab honours the address format preference you configure under **Customers → Configuration**. Operators can tag entries as primary, assign dictionary-backed types, and keep shipping/billing data split.

## Customer dictionaries and currencies

- **Open** **Customers → Configuration** to manage module-specific dictionaries—statuses, sources, lifecycle stages, job titles, deal stages, and address types. Each dictionary entry can carry a label, icon, and highlight colour for consistent UI badges.
- **Currency management** lives in the same dictionary interface. The customers CLI seeds a comprehensive currency list from `Intl.supportedValuesOf('currency')` (see `packages/core/src/modules/customers/cli.ts`). Refresh pulls the latest entries from parents when you inherit values across the org tree.
- **Scope** – dictionaries respect organization hierarchy. Entries marked _Inherited_ are read-only in child organizations; edit them at the source to cascade updates.
- **API and automations** reuse the same data. Dictionary CRUD endpoints sit under `/api/customers/dictionaries/{kind}` and accept JSON payloads validated with zod schemas.

## Features and access control

- **View** rights: `customers.people.view` and `customers.companies.view` gate their respective lists.
- **Manage** rights: `customers.people.manage`, `customers.companies.manage`, and `customers.activities.manage` allow create/update operations and activity logging.
- **Configuration**: only operators with `customers.settings.manage` can change dictionaries or address format preferences.
- Remember to pair feature grants with organization scope so multi-tenant deployments stay isolated.
