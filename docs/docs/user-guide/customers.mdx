The **Customers** module bundles company, people, and deal management into a single CRM workspace. Pages auto-discover from module metadata, so once features are assigned (`customers.*`) the navigation renders automatically under the _Customers_ section of the admin sidebar.

- **Companies workspace** — review account records, manage tabs for activities, deals, addresses, and keep linked contacts up to date. See [Companies](./customers/companies) for the complete walkthrough.
- **People workspace** — manage contact lists, interaction timelines, and linked deals or tasks without leaving the page. Dive into [People](./customers/people) for detailed UI guidance.
- **Deals workspace** — track pipeline health through lists and kanban boards, edit opportunity details, and collaborate with notes and activities. See [Deals](./customers/deals) for full coverage of the pipeline tooling.

## Customer dictionaries and currencies

- **Open** **Customers → Configuration** to manage module-specific dictionaries—statuses, sources, lifecycle stages, job titles, deal stages, and address types. Each dictionary entry can carry a label, icon, and highlight colour for consistent UI badges.
- **Currency management** lives in the same dictionary interface. The customers CLI seeds a comprehensive currency list from `Intl.supportedValuesOf('currency')` (see `packages/core/src/modules/customers/cli.ts`). Refresh pulls the latest entries from parents when you inherit values across the org tree.
- **Scope** – dictionaries respect organization hierarchy. Entries marked _Inherited_ are read-only in child organizations; edit them at the source to cascade updates.
- **API and automations** reuse the same data. Dictionary CRUD endpoints sit under `/api/customers/dictionaries/{kind}` and accept JSON payloads validated with zod schemas.

## Features and access control

- **View** rights: `customers.people.view`, `customers.companies.view`, and `customers.deals.view` gate the main workspaces.
- **Manage** rights: `customers.people.manage`, `customers.companies.manage`, `customers.deals.manage`, and `customers.activities.manage` allow create/update operations and activity logging.
- **Configuration**: only operators with `customers.settings.manage` can change dictionaries or address format preferences.
- Remember to pair feature grants with organization scope so multi-tenant deployments stay isolated.
