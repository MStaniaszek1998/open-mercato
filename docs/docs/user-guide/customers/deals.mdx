The deals workspace delivers kanban-style pipeline management alongside structured deal records. Grant `customers.deals.view` for read access and `customers.deals.manage` to let operators create, update, and move opportunities between stages.

## Track pipeline performance

- **List view** under **Customers → Deals** offers a sortable table with stage, probability, expected close, linked people and companies, and last update. Filters help sales leaders zero in on specific segments or owners.
- **Export** triggers a CSV of the current slice so pipeline reviews can happen offline. Every column maps to the deal entity exposed by `/api/customers/deals`.
- **Inline actions** open the deal, duplicate it, or jump straight to activity logging.

## Kanban pipeline board

- **Sales pipeline** presents stages as draggable columns. Drag deals between stages to update status instantly; undo prompts appear after each change to make corrections painless.
- **Stage configuration** pulls from the dictionary under **Customers → Configuration → Deal stages**. Each stage can expose colour coding to match the board headers and provide visual cues.
- **Lane metrics** show deal counts per stage, helping teams spot bottlenecks without leaving the board.

## Create and edit deals

- **Deal form** captures title, status, pipeline stage, value, currency, probability, and expected close date. Dictionaries power dropdowns, and custom fields appear in the panel on the right.
- **Associations** allow linking people and companies while creating or editing a deal. Search surfaces lifecycle badges so sellers can validate the right contact in seconds.
- **Undo support** keeps edits safe—each save operation includes an undo toast with `Undo` action.

## Collaborate on deal timelines

- **Highlights** display the key metrics at the top of the deal page: stage, probability, value, and expected close. Use the inline `Edit deal details` action to tweak them.
- **Notes** let teams leave free-form updates. Keyboard shortcuts (`Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to submit, `Escape` to close) mirror the rest of the app.

- **Activities** track structured interactions tied to the deal. Logging a call or meeting automatically links the selected people and company, reinforcing a full-funnel timeline across entities.
- **Log activity** dialog honours dictionary-driven activity types and custom fields, ensuring consistent reporting downstream.
