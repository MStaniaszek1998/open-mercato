Company records capture the account-level picture: metadata, linked contacts, associated deals, and shared activity history. `customers.companies.view` unlocks the grid and read-only detail pages; `customers.companies.manage` enables creation, editing, and association management.

## Browse companies

- **Customers → Companies** lists every organization-scoped account with lifecycle stage, next interaction badge, and key contact information. Filters, saved perspectives, and search reuse the standard data grid patterns so operators can quickly home in on high-priority accounts.
- **Export** visible rows or trigger automations from the kebab menu. All list and CRUD actions map to `/api/customers/companies`, so the same workflows work through the API or command bus.
- **Create or edit** companies with the top-right action buttons. The form honours dictionary-backed fields (industry, stage, geography), custom fields, and undo metadata to keep edits safe.

## Company detail workspace

![Company tabs](/screenshots/open-mercato-people-assigned-to-company.png)

- **Tabbed layout** keeps people, activities, deals, addresses, and tasks within reach. Use the header badges to understand how many associations exist without opening each tab.
- **People tab** lets teams add or unlink contacts inline. Search shows job titles, lifecycle stages, and key badges so you grab the right person. Quick actions include opening the person record in a new tab or unlinking, all without leaving the company page.
- **Deals tab** aggregates opportunities linked to the account so account managers can monitor pipeline coverage and jump to editing with one click.
- **Activities and notes** display the shared timeline for the entire account. Logging an interaction automatically attributes it to the company and any selected contacts or deals.
- **Addresses tab** mirrors the person view. Dictionary-driven address types and primary flags help operators manage billing versus shipping info cleanly.

## Configuration and automation hooks

- **Dictionaries** such as lifecycle stage, status, source, and geography live under **Customers → Configuration**. Changes cascade to both company and person forms so picklists stay in sync.
- **Custom fields** introduced through the entity designer appear automatically on the company form and detail view.
- **API & automation** — leverage command bus handlers in `packages/core/src/modules/customers/commands` to seed or sync company data. Each command enforces validation via the shared zod schemas.
