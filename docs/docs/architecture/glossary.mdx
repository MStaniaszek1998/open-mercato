| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Module** | Self-contained package delivering pages, APIs, entities, subscribers, and DI registrations. Resides under `packages/*/src/modules/<module>` or `src/modules/<module>`. |
| **Overlay** | App-level override for a module file. Any file in `src/modules/<module>` replaces the package implementation with the same relative path. |
| **Generator** | Script invoked by `npm run modules:prepare` that scans modules and emits `modules.generated.ts`, `entities.generated.ts`, and `di.generated.ts`. |
| **Query Engine** | Service that retrieves records and custom fields via a unified API. Lives inside the DI container as `queryEngine`. |
| **Data Engine** | Service that persists writes (especially custom fields) and emits events after successful operations. |
| **Custom Entity** | Runtime-defined entity managed by the entities module, often backed by EAV tables. |
| **Feature flag** | String identifier declared in `acl.ts` that can be required by pages, APIs, and widgets. |
| **Subscriber** | Module-defined function that reacts to events emitted through the event bus. Discovered automatically and executed asynchronously. |
| **Tenant / Organization** | Context objects attached to each request to preserve data isolation in multi-tenant deployments. |
| **Dashboard widget** | Client component discovered from modules and rendered on the admin dashboard. |
