title: Future roadmap
description: Upcoming improvements planned for the platform.

The roadmap evolves with customer feedback. Below are initiatives currently under exploration.

## Near term

- **Visual module scaffolder** – CLI + UI wizard that generates module skeletons, DI wiring, and dashboard widgets with opinionated defaults.
- **Entity analytics** – Materialised views that expose aggregated metrics per module and feed analytic dashboard widgets.
- **Event sequencing** – Switch the persistent event driver to use outbox tables per module, improving observability and replay speed.

## Mid term

- **GraphQL gateway** – Optional GraphQL layer that wraps module APIs and exposes typed schemas per tenant.
- **Extensible workflows** – Lightweight workflow engine to orchestrate multi-step business processes with retries and compensations.
- **UI schema editor** – Admin interface for composing forms and grids visually, backed by the same configuration DSL used in code.

## Long term

- **Multi-region tenancy** – Partition tenants across regions while sharing the same codebase and deployment pipeline.
- **Plug-in marketplace** – Distribute community modules securely with version constraints and signature enforcement.
- **Observability suite** – Bundled tracing, metrics, and alerting templates tailored for multi-tenant commerce applications.

Contributions and feedback are welcome—open a discussion on GitHub or submit a proposal following our module guidelines.
