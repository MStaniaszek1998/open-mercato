Follow these steps after the [prerequisites](./prerequisites) are in place:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato.git
   cd open-mercato
   ```
2. **Install workspace dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Bootstrap everything with one command**
   ```bash
   yarn mercato init
   ```
   This script prepares module registries, generates/applies migrations, seeds default roles, provisions an admin user, and loads demo CRM data (companies, people, deals, activities, todos). Add `--no-examples` if you prefer to skip the demo content while keeping core identities, or `--stresstest` (optionally with `-n <count>`) to preload thousands of synthetic contacts for performance testing.
4. **Launch the app**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/backend` and sign in with the credentials printed by `yarn mercato init`.
   If you plan to use the email-enabled onboarding flow, opt-in by setting the following environment variables in your `.env` (the toggle defaults to `false`):
    ```env
    RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
    APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
    EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@your-domain.com
    SELF_SERVICE_ONBOARDING_ENABLED=true
    ```

> ðŸ’¡ Need a clean slate? Run `yarn mercato init --reinstall`. It wipes module migrations and **drops the database**, so only use it when you intentionally want to reset everything. Prefer `yarn mercato init --no-examples` if you just want an empty CRM without resetting the database.

For advanced/manual flows (custom migration control, selective seeding, etc.) see the CLI reference in the repository README.
