description: Tools and services required before installing Open Mercato locally.
---

Before cloning the repository ensure the following tools are available:

- **Node.js 20.18+** – aligns with Next.js and Docusaurus requirements. Use `nvm` or `fnm` to manage versions.
- **pnpm 8 or npm 9 / Yarn 3** – pick one package manager and stick with it. The monorepo uses workspaces.
- **PostgreSQL 14+** – all modules rely on Postgres for persistence. Local development works great with Docker (`docker run --name mercato-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret postgres:15`).
- **Redis (optional)** – required when you enable persistent event delivery with the Redis driver; otherwise the file-backed queue works out-of-the-box.
- **OpenSSL** – used for generating secrets and TLS assets when running locally.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure at least:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:secret@localhost:5432/mercato
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

The docs site you are reading lives in `/docs` and has its own dependencies. Install them independently (`pnpm install` or `npm install`) when you want to build or preview the documentation.
