Open Mercato powers modern enterprise platforms where configurability, tenant isolation, and rapid iteration are non-negotiable. Whether you are building from scratch or extending legacy systems, these are the scenarios where the framework shines.

## Core Use Cases

- 💼 **CRM** – manage customers, opportunities, and playbooks using custom entities, validators, and dynamic forms tuned to each vertical.
- 🏭 **ERP** – orchestrate orders, production, services, or field operations with modules that mirror your unique processes.
- 🛒 **Commerce** – launch CPQ flows, B2B ordering portals, subscriptions, or complete commerce backends with reusable modules and APIs.
- 🌐 **Headless/API platform** – deliver mobile or web apps backed by a flexible data model, typed APIs, and an event-driven backbone.

## Highlights

- 🧩 **Modular architecture** – drop in your own modules, pages, APIs, and entities with auto-discovery and overlay overrides.
- 🧬 **Custom entities & dynamic forms** – declare fields, validators, and UI widgets per module and manage them live from the admin.
- 🏢 **Multi-tenant by default** – SaaS-ready tenancy with strict organization/tenant scoping for every entity and API.
- 🏛️ **Multi-hierarchical organizations** – built-in organization trees with role- and user-level visibility controls.
- 🛡️ **Feature-based RBAC** – combine per-role and per-user feature flags with organization scoping to gate any page or API.
- ⚡ **Data indexing & caching** – hybrid JSONB indexing and smart caching for blazing-fast queries across base and custom fields.
- 🔔 **Event subscribers & workflows** – publish domain events and process them via persistent subscribers (local or Redis).
- ✅ **Growing test coverage** – expanding unit and integration tests ensure modules stay reliable as you extend them.
- 🧠 **AI-supportive foundation** – structured for assistive workflows, automation, and conversational interfaces.
- ⚙️ **Modern stack** – Next.js App Router, TypeScript, zod, Awilix DI, MikroORM, and bcryptjs out of the box.
