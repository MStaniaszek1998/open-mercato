description: Ensures baseline roles exist for the authentication module.

`yarn mercato auth seed-roles` inserts or verifies the default role set used by the authentication module.

## Usage

```bash
yarn mercato auth seed-roles
```

## Behavior

- Runs inside a transaction and guarantees the roles `employee`, `admin`, and `superadmin` exist.
- Existing roles are left untouched; missing ones are created with `tenantId = null` so they can be reused across tenants.
- Outputs `Inserted role <name>` when a role is created and `Roles ensured` when complete.

## When to Run

- Immediately after project bootstrap (`yarn init` runs it automatically).
- Before calling [`mercato auth setup`](./auth-setup) in CI or scripts to make sure dependent roles exist.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database connection errors** — ensure `DATABASE_URL` is configured and the database is reachable.
- **Duplicate role warnings** — harmless. The command is idempotent and skips roles that already exist.
