description: Creates a tenant, organization, and seed users with optional derived accounts.
---

`yarn mercato auth setup` provisions the initial tenant and organization, seeds user accounts, and configures baseline role ACLs. It is safe to run multiple times; existing entities are reused and updated idempotently.

## Usage

```bash
yarn mercato auth setup --orgName "<organization>" --email "<superadmin@email>" --password "<password>" [--roles superadmin,admin,employee]
```

Aliases: `--name` for `--orgName`.

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--orgName`, `--name` | Organization display name. A tenant named `<orgName> Tenant` is created alongside it. | _(required)_ |
| `--email` | Primary superadmin email. If the local part is exactly `superadmin`, additional `admin@…` and `employee@…` users are derived automatically. | _(required)_ |
| `--password` | Password applied to all seeded users. | _(required)_ |
| `--roles` | Comma-separated list of roles to ensure exist before assignment. | `superadmin,admin,employee` |

## Behavior

1. Ensures each role in `--roles` exists (creating it if necessary).
2. Checks for an existing user with the supplied email:
   - If found, updates their password, tenant, organization, and role assignments without creating duplicates.
   - Logs a warning indicating that the existing account was reused.
3. Otherwise creates:
   - A tenant named `<orgName> Tenant`.
   - An organization `<orgName>` bound to the tenant.
   - A superadmin user for `--email` plus optional `admin@…` and `employee@…` accounts when the email local part is `superadmin`.
4. Rebuilds the organization hierarchy for the tenant.
5. Seeds default role ACLs:
   - Superadmin role marked `isSuperAdmin` with wildcard features.
   - Admin role receives broad feature coverage (`auth.*`, `entities.*`, `directory.organizations.*`, etc.).
   - Employee role is granted dashboard and example-module features.
6. Prints the resulting tenant, organization, and user IDs.

## Example

```bash
yarn mercato auth setup \
  --orgName "Acme HQ" \
  --email superadmin@acme.dev \
  --password ChangeMe123 \
  --roles superadmin,admin,employee
```

Output (abridged):

```
Created user superadmin@acme.dev password: ChangeMe123
Created user admin@acme.dev password: ChangeMe123
Created user employee@acme.dev password: ChangeMe123
Setup complete: { tenantId: '...', organizationId: '...' }
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing options** – the command prints the usage line and exits if `--orgName`, `--email`, or `--password` are not provided.
- **Existing data** – rerunning the command against an existing tenant will update user passwords and assignments rather than duplicating records.
- **Role mismatches** – ensure `mercato auth seed-roles` ran previously if you override the default role list.
