`yarn mercato example hello` simply prints `Hello from example module!`. Use it to confirm the `mercato` CLI can locate and execute module-specific commands.

## Usage

```bash
yarn mercato example hello
```

Expected output:

```
ðŸ§© Open Mercato CLI
Hello from example module!
```

If you see an error such as `Module "example" has no CLI commands`, ensure `modules:prepare` was run and the example module is enabled in the module registry.
