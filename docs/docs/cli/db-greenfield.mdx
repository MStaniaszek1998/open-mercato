description: Performs a destructive reset by clearing migrations, dropping tables, regenerating diffs, and reapplying them.
---

`yarn db:greenfield` executes `tsx scripts/mikro-modules.ts greenfield`. It is designed for **development only** when you want to rebuild the schema from scratch.

## Usage

```bash
yarn db:greenfield
```

## What the Command Does

1. Cleans every module’s `migrations/` directory by deleting generated migration `.ts` files and snapshot JSON files.
2. Removes checksum files under the repository’s `/generated` folder.
3. Drops per-module MikroORM migration tables (`mikro_orm_migrations_<module>`).
4. Drops **all** tables in the `public` schema of the database referenced by `DATABASE_URL`.
5. Regenerates fresh migrations for every enabled module by internally calling the `generate` mode.
6. Applies the newly generated migrations immediately.

## Safety Considerations

- The command irreversibly wipes the target database. Never run it against production or staging environments.
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` points to a disposable database before executing.
- Because it removes migration files, you may want to stash or commit any pending migration work beforehand.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Stop any dev servers using the database.
2. Run `yarn db:greenfield`.
3. Optionally execute [`yarn init`](./init) to reseed data and example content.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission errors when dropping tables** — verify the database user has privileges to drop tables and alter replication roles.
- **Migrations fail after regeneration** — inspect generated migration files and adjust entity definitions accordingly, then re-run `yarn db:greenfield` or `yarn db:migrate`.
