`yarn mercato auth list-orgs` enumerates every organization and displays the associated tenant ID, making it easy to target other CLI commands.

## Usage

```bash
yarn mercato auth list-orgs
```

## Output

```
Found 1 organization(s):

ID                                   | Name                    | Tenant ID                            | Created
-------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------
37efc239-87ab-4eb8-97f3-1cbbd7b497d0 | Acme HQ                 | 81c3b8b0-6f06-44f6-9c22-12c0d9ec3c63 | 2/18/2025
```

If no organizations exist, the command prints `No organizations found`.

## Use Cases

- Retrieve the `organizationId` for commands such as [`mercato auth add-user`](./auth-add-user) or [`mercato example seed-todos`](./example-seed-todos).
- Audit which tenants own which organizations without writing SQL.

## Troubleshooting

- **Empty result** – run [`mercato auth setup`](./auth-setup) first to seed the initial organization.
- **Timezone differences** – creation timestamps use the Node.js locale; export `TZ=UTC` if you need a stable timezone.
