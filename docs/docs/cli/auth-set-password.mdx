`yarn mercato auth set-password` updates the stored bcrypt hash for the specified user.

## Usage

```bash
yarn mercato auth set-password --email "<user@email>" --password "<newPassword>"
```

## Behavior

- Looks up the user by email.
- Hashes the supplied password with `bcryptjs` (cost 10).
- Persists the new hash and confirms the user.
- Prints a success message such as `✅ Password updated successfully for user: user@example.com`.

## Troubleshooting

- **User not found** – verify the email address, or list users with [`mercato auth list-users`](./auth-list-users).
- **Weak passwords** – the CLI does not enforce complexity, but downstream authentication may. Choose strong secrets manually.
- **Reused passwords** – hashing is idempotent; rerunning the command with the same password is safe.
